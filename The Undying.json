You also have advantage on saving throws against any disease.\n\nAdditionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of Fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.\n"}],"6":[{"featuretext":"Defy Death\n\nStarting at 6th level, you can give yourself vitality when you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on a death saving throw or when you stabilize a creature with Spare the Dying.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n"}],"10":[{"featuretext":"Undying Nature\n\nBeginning at 10th level, you can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests.\n\nIn addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.\n\n"}],"14":[{"featuretext":"Indestructible Life\n\nWhen you reach 14th level, you partake of some of the true secrets of the Undying.
