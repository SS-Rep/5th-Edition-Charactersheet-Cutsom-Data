As a bonus action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, you discern that this magic failed, and you can’t use this feature on the target again. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you until the end of your next turn, and you mentally learn the charmed target’s name or the fact that the target lacks a name.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.\n\nFateful Naming\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can bend magic to assist or hinder creatures through the power of their true names, and even use those names as an anchor to affect others around them. The bane and bless spells are wizard spells for you, and you add them to your spellbook. You always have them prepared, yet they don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare.\n\nYou can cast either spell without expending a spell slot if you speak the true name of one target of the spell as part of casting it.

Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one resonant you know with a different one.\n\nUsing a Resonant. You can use one Resonant when you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot and speak the true name of one creature targeted by the spell. Speaking the name is part of casting the spell.\n\nYou can use Resonants a number of times equal to half of your wizard level (round down), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nResonant Options. Here are your options when choosing a Resonant:\n\nAbsorption. When you cast a spell that deals damage to the named target, you gain 3d6 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points you gain increases by 1d6 when you reach 10th level (4d6) and 14th level (5d6) in this class.\n\nDevastation. If the spell requires the named creature to make a saving throw, that creature has disadvantage on the first save it makes against the spell.\n\nDissolution. The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, that creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage. The extra force damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 10th level (3d8) and 14th level (4d8) in this class.\n\nNullification. If the named target is affected by any other spells, you know what those spells are, and you can attempt to end one of your choice by succeeding on an Intelligence check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the chosen spell.\n\nPuppetry. The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, you can knock the creature prone or move it up to 10 feet, either directly toward you or away from you.\n\nSympathy. If the named creature is within range of the spell, you can target the creature with the spell even if you can’t see the creature or it has total cover against the spell.\n\n"}],"10":[{"featuretext":"Durable Magic\n\nBeginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm.
